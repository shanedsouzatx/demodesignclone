        Our mission is to facilitate recovery and improve the overall quality of life for children and adults with behavioral health problems and developmental disabilities. Using an individualized behavior analytic case formulation and the evidence-based treatments from applied behavioral science, Behavior Analysis & Therapy Partners (BATP) seeks to improve the behavioral health and wellbeing of children, families, and adults. Our goal is to strengthen the community’s capacity to deal with behavioral health issues through the delivery of behavior analytically based, time limited, accountable effective and accessible treatment oriented behavioral services.

We respect families and seek to empower families to live life in accord with their higher values and to help their children overcome their behavioral health disabilities. We are committed to supporting and guiding our staff to help them grow in a healthy, friendly, community-oriented environment.
