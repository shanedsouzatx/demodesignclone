Using an individualized behavior analytic case formulation and the evidence-based treatments from applied behavioral science, Behavior Analysis & Therapy Partners (BATP) seeks to improve the behavioral health and wellbeing of children, families, and adults.

We respect families and seek to empower families to live life in accord with their higher values and to help their children overcome their behavioral health disabilities. We are committed to supporting and guiding our staff to help them grow in a healthy, friendly, community-oriented environment.
